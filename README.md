# CPU Simulator in TkGate

[![Tool](https://img.shields.io/badge/Simulator-TkGate-orange.svg)](http://www.tkgate.org/)

A **CPU simulator** built in **TkGate**, designed to demonstrate fundamental computer architecture concepts.  
This project implements a simple CPU capable of executing basic **assembly instructions** and simulates how a processor fetches, decodes, and executes them.

---

## 📌 Features
- CPU design implemented using **TkGate**
- Support for a subset of **assembly instructions**
- Demonstrates the **fetch–decode–execute cycle**
- Registers, ALU, memory, and control unit simulation
- Educational project for learning **digital logic & computer architecture**
